# Re2TAL
Repository for the CVPR23 paper ```Re^2TAL: Rewiring Pretrained Video Backbones for Reversible Temporal Action Localization```


Pleaser refer to the repo https://github.com/sming256/OpenTAD.git for a crude implementation of Re2TAL. 

We are working on a more elegant version. Please stay tuned.
